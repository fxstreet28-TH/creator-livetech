/**
 * Everything /live/[sessionId] needs before it can render: the session's
 * metadata, who is broadcasting it, and either a way to watch or the reason
 * there is not one.
 *
 * The two-source shape is forced by RLS, the same way usePublicPost's is.
 * `live_sessions_public_active_read` exposes only `access_level = 'public'`
 * rows, and `live_sessions_subscriber_read` only adds the subscriber's own —
 * so a PPV session, and a subscribers session seen by a non-subscriber, read
 * back as NO ROW, indistinguishable from a session that does not exist.
 * `live-get-playback-url` runs as the service role and sees every row, so its
 * refusal is what turns "no row" into "locked". The full sequence:
 *
 *   1. read live_sessions. A row means the viewer can at least see the
 *      metadata — and if it says 'ended' or 'cancelled', there is nothing to
 *      watch and no URL is asked for.
 *   2. ask for a playback URL:
 *        200                     -> watch (LL-HLS, or LiveKit for a session
 *                                   with no Bunny stream)
 *        403 access_denied       -> lock card
 *        409 not_active          -> the session ended between (1) and (2)
 *        503 platform_unavailable-> the budget kill switch
 *        404                     -> genuinely no such session
 *   3. resolve the creator, when (1) gave us a creator_id to resolve.
 *
 * Asked for on mount rather than on a tap: this call is what decides
 * entitlement, and a viewer who taps play only to be told they are not allowed
 * in has been made to wait for a refusal.
 *
 * TWO THINGS RUN ON TIMERS, and both are new to the LL-HLS design:
 *
 *  - THE URL EXPIRES. A playback URL is minted with a one-hour TTL and a
 *    60-minute broadcast is an explicit requirement, so it is refreshed. A
 *    LiveKit viewer token was minted once and the room outlived it.
 *  - THE END OF THE BROADCAST HAS TO BE NOTICED. A LiveKit viewer was told:
 *    the room closed under them and the SDK fired Disconnected. An HLS viewer
 *    is told nothing — the playlist simply stops growing, which looks
 *    identical to a creator whose upload stalled — so the session's status is
 *    polled instead. Without this a viewer sits on a frozen last frame after
 *    the creator has pressed "จบไลฟ์".
